    <img src="image3.png" alt="Image 1">
    <p>Maharashtra, located in western India, is the third-largest state by area and the second-most populous in the
      country. Formed on May 1, 1960, it celebrates this day as Maharashtra Day. Mumbai, its capital, is India's
      financial hub and home to the Bollywood film industry, while Pune is known as the cultural capital and a hub for
      education and IT. The state is bordered by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Karnataka, Goa, and
      the Arabian Sea. Marathi is the official language, and the state boasts a rich cultural heritage, with festivals
      like Ganesh Chaturthi being celebrated with grandeur. Maharashtra is home to UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as
      Ajanta and Ellora Caves and landmarks like the Gateway of India. Its geography ranges from the Western Ghats to
      the Konkan coastline, famous for its beaches and seafood. The state is a leading producer of sugarcane, cotton,
      and soybeans and has a robust industrial base, including automobiles, IT, and textiles. Historical forts like
      Raigad and Pratapgad reflect its glorious Maratha legacy, led by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Folk arts like
      Lavani, Tamasha, and Warli painting thrive here, alongside modern infrastructure like India's first monorail in
      Mumbai. Maharashtra is also known for its hill stations like Mahabaleshwar, wildlife sanctuaries like Tadoba, and
      pilgrimage sites such as Shirdi. With its blend of tradition and modernity, Maharashtra remains one of Indiaâ€™s
      most vibrant and economically significant states.</p>
