    <p>Here’s a 30-line composition about Punjab:

        ---
        
        Punjab, often called the "Land of Five Rivers," is a vibrant state in northern India known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and agricultural prosperity. The state is named after the five rivers—Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab, and Jhelum—that once flowed through its fertile plains.
        
        Amritsar, the spiritual heart of Punjab, is home to the Golden Temple, a symbol of peace and equality. The temple's shimmering gold and serene Sarovar attract millions of devotees and tourists from across the world. The nearby Wagah Border showcases patriotic fervor during its daily ceremonies.
        
        Punjabi culture is renowned for its energy and zest for life. The traditional folk dances, Bhangra and Giddha, are a celebration of joy, often performed during festivals and weddings. Punjabi music, with its dhol beats and vibrant tunes, has gained global popularity.
        
        The state is known as India’s breadbasket due to its vast agricultural lands. Crops like wheat, rice, and sugarcane flourish here, thanks to the hardworking spirit of its farmers. Punjab’s festivals, such as Lohri, Baisakhi, and Gurpurab, highlight its cultural and religious diversity.
        
        Punjabi cuisine is a gastronomic delight, offering iconic dishes like butter chicken, sarson da saag with makki di roti, and lassi. The warmth of Punjabi hospitality ensures every guest is treated like family.
        
        Punjab's history is deeply intertwined with India's freedom struggle. Jallianwala Bagh and the Partition Museum in Amritsar are poignant reminders of the sacrifices made by its people. The state is also home to historical forts, such as Gobindgarh Fort and Qila Mubarak, reflecting its glorious past.
        
        Modern Punjab is a dynamic blend of tradition and progress. Its cities, like Ludhiana and Chandigarh, are hubs of industry, education, and innovation. Despite its modernization, Punjab retains its deep-rooted values of community, resilience, and unity.
        
        Punjab is not just a state but a feeling—a celebration of life, courage, and the indomitable spirit of its people.
